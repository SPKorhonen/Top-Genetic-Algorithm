NSGA is a popular non-domination based genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization. It is a very effective algorithm but has been generally criticized for its computational complexity, lack of elitism and for choosing the optimal parameter value for sharing parameter σshare. A modified version, NSGA II  was developed, which has a better sorting algorithm , incorporates elitism and no sharing parameter needs to be chosen a priori.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Python           | 59    | 32    |
